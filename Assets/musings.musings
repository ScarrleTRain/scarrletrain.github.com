What if rhinos are actually warrior unicorns?
I know they're big, fat and ugly, but can't warriors be too?
Also be careful because I think they can probably teleport, and if you know about them, they teleport to you and take you away :P

What if all the devices in my house are robots?
What if at night they all wake up and romp around and pull our nose hairs?
Wouldn't that be freaky.
Probably not too far off with the rise of AI and IoT.
