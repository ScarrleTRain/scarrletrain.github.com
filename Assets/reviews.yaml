      really chill album and their bass player and drummer are goated.  
      I like the synths and pads too bc it makes it easy to study to  

      Highlights: Blunted Again, Comedown, Spookydope

  "This Place Will Become Your Tomb - Sleep Token":

      soft and hard at the same time, his vocals are heavenly and
      emotional V.V and there are some great breakdowns.  
      I listen to it in the shower and studying but its a bit
      distracting because it's too damn good.  

      also this album is kinda underrated because a lot of people
      prefer their other album *Take Me Back To Eden* (which is also
      great) but I prefer this one  

      Highlights: Atlantic, Hypnosis, nvm just all of them

      I've enjoyed this album for a long time, I first started listening
      probably around 2018 or 2019 but I just love the way their vocalists
      contrast each other so much.  

      I really like the screamo's (Jon Mess) scream style and the singer's
      purity. Their guitars are insane as well, awesome melodic style.  

      They're one of the highlights of swancore and I'm a bit sad that I've
      never been able to find anyone like them, especially after they
      switched their vocalist recently (2025).  

      Highlights: Chucky vs. The Giant Tortiose, Deception, Inspire the
      Liars, Exposed, Man Of The Year

      this is just an EP but I really enjoy it.  
      my girlfriend introduced it to me in some of her spotify playlists
      but it's just a good vibe  

      Highlights: iloveyou, blushing!
