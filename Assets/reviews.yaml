      this book just straight up blew my mind the first time I read it. the rest of the series is also good
      but i didnt find them as satisfying.

      I really loved all the concepts in this one and how close it was to true theoretical physics
      as well as being really really interesting. in the first book it was also really cool to learn
      about the chinese revolution, which is something I havent seen before. overall the concept
      is just amazing

      I first read this series as a young preteen and I've read it over again multiple times.
      I really enjoy the concept of it and it's a great execution. I haven't read them in 
      a while but I've been a bit preoccupied currently, but I was wanting to reread them sometime soon.
  "The Divide Series - J. S. Dewes":

    review: |
      currently reading this series, but i really like the sci-fi part of it, the universe shrinking
      and alien, dark matter kinda stuff. also theres this romantic tension between two characters
      and >w< WHY DONT THEY JUST GET TOGETHER *dies. but its complex enough that its still fascinating
      and not just riding on that.

      really chill album and their bass player and drummer are goated.  
      I like the synths and pads too bc it makes it easy to study to  

      Highlights: Blunted Again, Comedown, Spookydope

  "This Place Will Become Your Tomb - Sleep Token":

    review: |
      soft and hard at the same time, his vocals are heavenly and
      emotional V.V and there are some great breakdowns.  
      I listen to it in the shower and studying but its a bit
      distracting because it's too damn good.  

      also this album is kinda underrated because a lot of people
      prefer their other album Take Me Back To Eden (which is also
      great) but I prefer this one  

      Highlights: Atlantic, Hypnosis, nvm just all of them

  "Mothership - Dance Gavin Dance":

      I've enjoyed this album for a long time, I first started listening
      probably around 2018 or 2019 but I just love the way their vocalists
      contrast each other so much.  

      I really like the screamo's (Jon Mess) scream style and the singer's
      purity. Their guitars are insane as well, awesome melodic style.  

      They're one of the highlights of swancore and I'm a bit sad that I've
      never been able to find anyone like them, especially after they
      switched their vocalist recently (2025).  

      Highlights: Chucky vs. The Giant Tortiose, Deception, Inspire the
      Liars, Exposed, Man Of The Year

  "LP2 - Secret Band":

      Grew up on this, just over the radio, listening to Tom Morello's wacky guitar techniques
      and some of my favourite basslines. also yesyes THE GOVERNMENT IS BAD WE LOVE ANARCHY (or sth like tht)
      the rapping style is cool.

      Highlights: Wake Up (my first RATM song), Killing In the Name, Take the Power Back, Bullet In the Head, Know Your Enemy

      I really enjoy being the only person i know who listens to a band. these guys are really small
      but i've listened to them from the start and this is a collection of their first five songs
      and I just thouroughly enjoy the entire thing. some of the lyrics are really meaningful

      Highlights: All of them

  "Tsunami Sea - Spiritbox":

    review: |
      ok, this album doesnt have my favourite songs, but its the album i listen to the most. 
      Courtney LaPlante's voice is two sides of an ephemeral coin.

      Highlights: All of these (+ From Eternal Blue: Sun Killer, Holy Roller, Eternal Blue, We Live In A Strange World, Circle With Me)
  
  "Pressure - Wage War":

    review: |
      This is another old one that I dont listen to that much but still gotta pay tribute to the beginning
      of my metal journey. Tbh I dont enjoy the typical metal sound anymore but these guys were pivotal.
      Also they have good morals and they sing about good things.

      Highlights: Who I Am, Me Against Myself, Hurt, Low, Will We Ever Learn

  "Blurryface - Twenty One Pilots":

      THESE GUYS ARE AWESOME. i really like beastie boys and their style and I just think its so cool
      how these guys use their adaption of that style in this era. their use of samples are really effective
      and i also enjoy all their modern day references. also shoutout to their other album NO HANDS (also really really good)

      Highlights: PUNK TACTICS, WATCH YO STEP, STARTAFIGHT, GUMDROP, HOOLIGANG

      i really like this guys voice and that he doesnt rap about money, girls and drugs (mostly). Hes pretty wholesome
      and down-to-earth. definitely one of my favourite rappers. the producing is peak too, its chill but also has really cool ideas

      Highlights: All I Do, 5 A.M., Ballin, Man Of The Year, Dead Presidents III, Walk

      this album is a great dark jazz album, and i really just love the atmostphere of it. its really good for studying to
      and just chilling. I would really like to compose something like this, or play even if its possible to do live.

      Highlights: Praga, Niechęć, but the rest are really cool (the names are too hard to remember)

      these guys just have a good vibe yk. all the songs are just good. I like poppy but also punkish feel.
