      this book just straight up blew my mind the first time I read it. the rest of the series is also good
      but i didnt find them as satisfying.

    review: |
      This series rivals Ender's Game as the best series I've ever read. Very ell done, and i particularly
      enjoy the large scale of it all, in a very omnipotent way, not character driven but about the rise and
      fall of a civilization. The way it is written is very loquacious and elegant. VERY VERY well done.

    review: |
      I first read this series as a young preteen and I've read it over again multiple times.
      I really enjoy the concept of it and it's a great execution. I haven't read them in 
      a while but I've been a bit preoccupied currently, but I was wanting to reread them sometime soon.
  "The Divide Series - J. S. Dewes":
    url: divideseries.jpg
    review: |
      currently reading this series, but i really like the sci-fi part of it, the universe shrinking
      and alien, dark matter kinda stuff. also theres this romantic tension between two characters
      and >w< WHY DONT THEY JUST GET TOGETHER *dies. but its complex enough that its still fascinating
      and not just riding on that.

  "Jazzbois Goes Blunt II - Jazzbois":
    url: jazzboisgoesblunt2.jpeg
    review: |
      really chill album and their bass player and drummer are goated.  
      I like the synths and pads too bc it makes it easy to study to  

      Highlights: Blunted Again, Comedown, Spookydope

  "This Place Will Become Your Tomb - Sleep Token":
    url: tpwbyt.jpeg
    review: |
      soft and hard at the same time, his vocals are heavenly and
      emotional V.V and there are some great breakdowns.  
      I listen to it in the shower and studying but its a bit
      distracting because it's too damn good.  

      also this album is kinda underrated because a lot of people
      prefer their other album Take Me Back To Eden (which is also
      great) but I prefer this one  

      Highlights: Atlantic, Hypnosis, nvm just all of them

  "Mothership - Dance Gavin Dance":

    review: |
      I've enjoyed this album for a long time, I first started listening
      probably around 2018 or 2019 but I just love the way their vocalists
      contrast each other so much.  

      I really like the screamo's (Jon Mess) scream style and the singer's
      purity. Their guitars are insane as well, awesome melodic style.  

      They're one of the highlights of swancore and I'm a bit sad that I've
      never been able to find anyone like them, especially after they
      switched their vocalist recently (2025).  

      Highlights: Chucky vs. The Giant Tortiose, Deception, Inspire the
      Liars, Exposed, Man Of The Year

  "LP2 - Secret Band":
    url: lp2.jpg
    review: |
      if u like screamo - YES. Jon Mess's tone is immaculate. and yes. yes. yes yes. wacky lyrics.
      I taught myself (and yt) how to scream bc of him 

      Highlights: Upgrades, Rabbit Hole, Meat Bag, Moon

  "we just need some time together - BETWEEN FRIENDS":

    review: |
      this is just an EP but I really enjoy it.  
      my girlfriend introduced it to me in some of her spotify playlists
      but it's just a good vibe  

      Highlights: iloveyou, blushing!

  "FISSION - Dead Poet Society":
    url: fission.jpeg
    review: |
      I really like the guitars tones - REALLY REALLY crunched. their vocalist has this really cool
      vocal style that i enjoy and their breakdowns are just *chefs kiss*

      Highlights: Running In Circles, HURT, I hope you hate me., 81 Tonnes, My Condition

  "BUMMER - cleopatrick":
    url: bummer.jpg
    review: |
      The guitar tones - crunch crunch crunch (*insert image of crunch bar ;P). AND the way
      that mr singer like slides and the saturation on everything and just mmMM. very very nice.

    url: ratm.jpg
    review: |
      Grew up on this, just over the radio, listening to Tom Morello's wacky guitar techniques
      and some of my favourite basslines. also yesyes THE GOVERNMENT IS BAD WE LOVE ANARCHY (or sth like tht)
      the rapping style is cool.

      Highlights: Wake Up (my first RATM song), Killing In the Name, Take the Power Back, Bullet In the Head, Know Your Enemy

    review: |
      I really enjoy being the only person i know who listens to a band. these guys are really small
      but i've listened to them from the start and this is a collection of their first five songs
      and I just thouroughly enjoy the entire thing. some of the lyrics are really meaningful

      Highlights: All of them

  "Tsunami Sea - Spiritbox":
    url: tsea.jpg
    review: |
      ok, this album doesnt have my favourite songs, but its the album i listen to the most. 
      Courtney LaPlante's voice is two sides of an ephemeral coin.

      Highlights: All of these (+ From Eternal Blue: Sun Killer, Holy Roller, Eternal Blue, We Live In A Strange World, Circle With Me)
  
  "Pressure - Wage War":
    url: pressure.jpg
    review: |
      This is another old one that I dont listen to that much but still gotta pay tribute to the beginning
      of my metal journey. Tbh I dont enjoy the typical metal sound anymore but these guys were pivotal.
      Also they have good morals and they sing about good things.

      Highlights: Who I Am, Me Against Myself, Hurt, Low, Will We Ever Learn

  "Blurryface - Twenty One Pilots":
    url: blurf.jpg
    review: |

      which suits me bc im a music nerd and listen to everything.

      Highlights: Heavydirtysoul, Stressed Out, Ride, Tear in My Heart, Lane Boy, Doubt

  "Punk Tactics - Joey Valence and Brae":
    url: punktactics.jpeg
    review: |
      THESE GUYS ARE AWESOME. i really like beastie boys and their style and I just think its so cool
      how these guys use their adaption of that style in this era. their use of samples are really effective
      and i also enjoy all their modern day references. also shoutout to their other album NO HANDS (also really really good)

      Highlights: PUNK TACTICS, WATCH YO STEP, STARTAFIGHT, GUMDROP, HOOLIGANG

  "YS Collection Vol. 1 - Logic":
    url: yscollection.jpeg
    review: |
      i really like this guys voice and that he doesnt rap about money, girls and drugs (mostly). Hes pretty wholesome
      and down-to-earth. definitely one of my favourite rappers. the producing is peak too, its chill but also has really cool ideas

      Highlights: All I Do, 5 A.M., Ballin, Man Of The Year, Dead Presidents III, Walk 

  "Unsubscribe (Deluxe Edition) -  Niechęć":
    url: unsubscribe.jpeg
    review: |
      this album is a great dark jazz album, and i really just love the atmostphere of it. its really good for studying to
      and just chilling. I would really like to compose something like this, or play even if its possible to do live.

      Highlights: Praga, Niechęć, but the rest are really cool (the names are too hard to remember)

  "FFTR/VFASF - poptropicaslutz!":
    url: fftr-vfasf.jpeg
    review: |
      the full name is actually Face For The Radio / Voice For A Silent Film (Deluxe) but that was too long lmao.
      these guys just have a good vibe yk. all the songs are just good. I like poppy but also punkish feel.

      Highlights: Falling Apart In Halftime, Upside Down, What Would You Do To Get Ahead(line)?, ... ALL OF THEM

    review: |
      I love this game and its so amazing and its great. I remember watching my older cousin play it
      as a child when she came over from Australia. Open world games are the best and being able to 
      do whatever you want is awesome. I put it down for a long while after beating the final boss, but then
      as I started a new game there was just so more I hadnt done. so - yes.
  "The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom":

    review: |
      tbh basically the same as the above, and I only loaned it from a friend but I really love it. some people
      say its too similar to the first one and its not worth it, but idk. in theory yes, but its still new and exciting
      for me and i have just as much fun playing it.
  "Valorant":

    review: |
      well..... ik people have mixed opinions for this but our servers generally havent been as toxic as people say
      and i play for fun. I do play ranked but im so bad and tbh i dont really care enough to put so much time into 
      it to get super good. but i will say its very addictive so - warning.

      I did enjoy this game for a long while when I first got my switch and started gaming, but I started to find it 
      a bit monotonous and tedious so I've stopped playing it. BUT i did play it for a very long time, I think in total
      250 hours? (I had a 1 hour limit on weekdays and couldnt play weekends so yes it's a small number but it was a lot for me)
